	<p>When you are practicing "catch and release", there are certain tactics that you must learn in order to preserve the species.  Here at Tippet, we aren't solely dedicated to any specific fish species.  Let's face the truth, though.  The primary species that most fly anglers focus on is trout.  The following guidelines are specifically for trout.  It doesn't matter if you are targeting brown, cutthroat, rainbow, or brook trout.  Any caught trout will require special handling techniques.  Most other species do not require as much attention to detail, while some others will require a totally different approach.  Being that trout are rather sensitive, they can die easily from exhaustion or trauma.</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Use a Net</h4>
	<p>The optimal scenario is that you use hemostats to dislodge the hook before ever pulling the fish out of the water.  Whenever anglers want to take a quick photo with their catch, however, they should only keep the fish out of water for a very short time.  Using a net can assist the angler with all of this.  It can also aid in getting that huge fish in because tippets tend to break most often when an angler tugs on them.  Try to get a net that is made of modern synthetic material and avoid the traditional nets made of fabric.  Not only do hooks tend to get matted into them, but fabric nets also soak up some of the protective slime on a trout.</p>
	<br>
	<h4>Limit Contact</h4>
	<p>Whether using a net or not, one of your primary goals should be limiting contact with the fish.  Think of it this way: the more you handle a fish, the closer it nears death.  You want the trout to retain as much of its slime coat as possible and you don't want to "infect" the fish with watever you have on your hands.  Always wet your bare hands in the water before touching the fish.  Never "lip" the fish like you would a bass and never prod behind the gill plates.</p>
	<br>
	<h4>Go Barbless</h4>
	<p>Alright, this is a tough one, but no fishing guide would be complete without talking about hooks.  The basic thing here is that barbed hooks do more damage to the fish.  If you buy flies, buy barbless.  If you tie flies, tie barbless.  If you have barbed hooks on your flies already, remove the barbs.  This can be done easily with a small set of pliers.  Aside from that, a barbless hook can allow you to remove the hook much faster.  This further protects the fish because it will spend less time out of the water.</p>
	<br>
	<h4>Resuscitation</h4>
	<p>If a fish is large and puts up a nice fight, they may need some resuscitation.  Exhaustion will kill some fish that are not properly resuscitated.  Some anglers refer to this as "reviving" the fish.  This typically isn't needed for smaller fish, as long as you don't have them out of the water for too long.  When a fish does need to be resuscitated, hold it steady beneath the water surface with its nose facing the current.  This process may take just a few seconds, but could require up to a minute.  When the fish starts to flutter, it has been resuscitated and you may let it swim away freely.  When fishing a lake or pond, you may have no current to assist you.  In this case, you can VERY lightly rock the fish back and forth to create some water flow to help the fish get more oxygen.</p>
